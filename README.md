* Inspirations: Exerion, Wolfenstein 3D

## Narrative Background

* Wanderers: Catalyst is the third game to be designed and set in the The Wanderers Cycle universe
  * The Outer Reaches is a sandbox universe intended for game jams and prototyping
  * The Outer Reaches' creation is a direct result of the [#js13k](https://js13kgames.com/) 2020 theme, "404"
  * Narratively speaking, Wanderers: Catalyst is the prequel to Wanderers and Wanderers: War Stories
* Wanderers is a collectible trading card military space RPG and is under active design review with physical cards
  * After being cut-off from the reset of the Galaxy, Species 404 lays waste to humanity throughout the Outer Reaches
* Wanderers: War Stories is a simpler, much faster paced card game
  * Where Wanderers focuses on the stories of individuals and crews in their struggles against Species 404, Wanderers: War Stories provides a different view of the war - from the perspective of individual star systems
* Neither was submitted for js13k 2020, but are likely to be released at some point in the future at [www.wanderersgame.com](https://www.wanderersgame.com/)
